# Analytics Database Manager #

## What ##

Improved version of the ADM already located on the Sitecore Marketplace.

## Why ##

The existing module needed some improvements. The Github-code was ancient and the authors unreachable, so I made my own spinoff.

## Compatibility ##

The module was created and tested on Sitecore 8.1 update-3.

## Usage ##

### Installation ###

The module is made available on the Sitecore marketplace as a Sitecore package. The package includes:

- Sitecore items for the visual interface
- a config file that includes a pipeline processor, settings and the default userAgents and userAgentParts that are identified as robots
- a js-file
- the dll
 
## History ##
- v3.5 : first modified version
